## üöÄ Getting Started

### Accessing Analytics
1. Open GhostWriter
2. Navigate to the **üìä Analytics** section in the sidebar
3. Select a project from the dropdown
4. Choose your time range (7 days, 30 days, 90 days, or 1 year)
5. View comprehensive insights about your codebase

### Understanding the Dashboard

#### **Overall Health Score**
- **Excellent (80-100)**: Your codebase is in great shape
- **Good (60-79)**: Generally healthy with room for improvement
- **Fair (40-59)**: Some issues that should be addressed
- **Poor (0-39)**: Significant improvements needed

#### **Key Metrics**
- **Maintainability**: How easy it is to modify and extend the code
- **Complexity**: Cyclomatic complexity of functions and methods
- **Security**: Potential security vulnerabilities detected
- **Comments**: Documentation coverage ratio

#### **Technology Stack**
- Shows detected languages, frameworks, and libraries
- File count per technology
- Usage patterns and trends

#### **Evolution Trends**
- Daily/weekly commit activity
- Lines of code changes
- Development velocity patterns

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
The analytics system uses several new tables:
- `code_metrics`: Stores code health measurements
- `tech_stack_analysis`: Technology detection results
- `code_evolution`: Change tracking data
- `project_analytics`: Aggregated project summaries

### API Endpoints
- `GET /analytics/health/:projectName` - Get health metrics
- `GET /analytics/tech-stack/:projectName` - Get technology stack
- `GET /analytics/evolution/:projectName` - Get evolution trends
- `GET /analytics/summary/:projectName` - Get comprehensive summary

### IPC Handlers
- `analytics:get-project-health` - Frontend health metrics
- `analytics:get-tech-stack` - Technology stack data
- `analytics:get-evolution` - Evolution tracking data
- `analytics:generate-project-analytics` - Full analytics summary

## üé® AI-Powered Recommendations

The system provides intelligent recommendations based on your codebase:

### **Code Health Alerts**
- Low maintainability scores
- High complexity warnings
- Security vulnerability alerts
- Documentation gaps

### **Development Insights**
- Active development detection
- Performance optimization suggestions
- Best practices recommendations
- Team productivity insights

## üìà Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Visual Charts**: Interactive charts and graphs
- **Trend Analysis**: Long-term pattern recognition
- **Team Analytics**: Individual contributor insights
- **Custom Metrics**: User-defined measurement criteria
- **Export Reports**: PDF/HTML analytics reports
- **Integration APIs**: Third-party tool connections

### Advanced Analytics
- **Predictive Analysis**: Future code quality predictions
- **Refactoring Suggestions**: AI-powered improvement recommendations
- **Dependency Analysis**: Impact assessment of changes
- **Performance Metrics**: Runtime performance analysis

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### Analytics Settings
The analytics system automatically runs when you ingest code. No additional configuration is required, but you can:

1. **Adjust Time Ranges**: Select different time periods for analysis
2. **Filter Projects**: Focus on specific projects or codebases
3. **Custom Thresholds**: Modify alert thresholds (future feature)

### Performance Considerations
- Analytics processing happens asynchronously during ingestion
- Database queries are optimized with proper indexing
- Large codebases are processed efficiently
- Results are cached for quick dashboard loading

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **No Data Available**: Ensure you've ingested code for the selected project
2. **Missing Metrics**: Some metrics require specific file types or patterns
3. **Slow Loading**: Large projects may take time to analyze

### Debug Information
- Check the console for analytics processing logs
- Verify database tables are created properly
- Ensure file permissions for database access

## üìö API Reference

### Frontend API
```typescript
// Get project health metrics
const health = await window.electronAPI.getProjectHealth({
  projectName: "my-project",
  days: 30
});

// Get technology stack
const techStack = await window.electronAPI.getTechStack({
  projectName: "my-project"
});

// Get evolution trends
const evolution = await window.electronAPI.getEvolution({
  projectName: "my-project",
  days: 90
});

// Get comprehensive analytics
const analytics = await window.electronAPI.getProjectAnalytics({
  projectName: "my-project"
});
```

### HTTP API
```bash
# Get health metrics
curl http://localhost:3001/analytics/health/my-project?days=30

# Get technology stack
curl http://localhost:3001/analytics/tech-stack/my-project

# Get evolution data
curl http://localhost:3001/analytics/evolution/my-project?days=90

# Get full summary
curl http://localhost:3001/analytics/summary/my-project
```
